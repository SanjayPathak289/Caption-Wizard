# Description
• Developed an app in Kotlin for generating subtitles for user-uploaded videos (English language only) and audios using the Vosk AI model.  
• Used FFmpeg to extract audio from the video file.  
• Built an integrated video editor in the app allowing users to review and edit generated subtitles with a built-in video player.  
• Enabled users to export edited subtitles as SRT files for easy use and sharing.  
• Created a user dashboard for managing all uploaded videos and srt files.
